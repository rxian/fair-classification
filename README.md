# Fair Classification via Post-Processing

Post-process scoring models for demographic parity.

Post-processor is implemented in `postprocess.py`.

Notebooks `dp_acsincome.ipynb`, `dp_biasbios.ipynb`, `dp_adult.ipynb`, and `dp_communities.ipynb` reproduce the results in:

```bibtex
@inproceedings{xian2023FairOptimalClassification,
  title     = {Fair and {{Optimal Classification}} via {{Post-Processing}}},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 40th {{International Conference}} on {{Machine Learning}}},
  author    = {Xian, Ruicheng and Yin, Lang and Zhao, Han},
  year      = {2023}
}
```
